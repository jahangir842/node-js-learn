## What is npm?

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to:

- Install, share, and manage third-party packages (libraries and tools) for Node.js projects.
- Manage project dependencies through the `package.json` file.
- Run scripts for building, testing, and running applications.
- Publish and share their own packages with the community via the npm registry (https://www.npmjs.com/).

npm comes bundled with Node.js, so you get it automatically when you install Node.js.

### Common npm Commands
- `npm init` – Initialize a new Node.js project and create a `package.json` file.
- `npm install <package>` – Install a package and add it to your project dependencies.
- `npm run <script>` – Run a script defined in your `package.json`.
- `npm update` – Update installed packages.
- `npm uninstall <package>` – Remove a package from your project.
